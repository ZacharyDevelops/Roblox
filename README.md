Hello! My name is Zachary! I am a Roblox Scripter, Programmer in C#, and Cybersecurity Specialist. 

If you are reading this, I have been programming in roblox for two and a half years. 

As a former Roblox exploiter I know how to keep games safe from other peoples exploits.

I am a 13 year old autistic boy who enjoys everything about computers. 

Here is some examples of my basic roblox work.
